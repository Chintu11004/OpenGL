# Personal Project
Basically, I follow LearnOpenGL tutorials to understand and use OpenGL in hopes to one day make my own game engine. This repository serves as a version control for my progress throughout the tutorials.

As of the first commit, I have completed the Getting Started Section of the Book.

Below I shall make date notes of the commits I have made everyday:
18th Jun, 25 - Added a Cube.cpp and Cube.h class to make rendering a cube a few commands instead of clogging up the main method. Should work to add texture to it, and or colour at certain vertices.
